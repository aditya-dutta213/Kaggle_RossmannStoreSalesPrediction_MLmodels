# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

This project explores machine learning approaches for predicting sales at Rossmann stores, leveraging techniques from Aakash N S's tutorial on how to approach ML problems. The notebook systematically goes through the stages of a predictive modeling task:

- Downloading and preparing the Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle.
- Exploring the dataset through visual and statistical analysis to understand key features.
- Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and categorical data encoding.
- Building and tuning machine learning models such as decision trees and random forests to predict sales.
- Analyzing the importance of different features in the prediction models.
- Evaluating the models' performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ².
